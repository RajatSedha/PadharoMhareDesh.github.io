	<h1>Papad Ki Sabji</h1>
	<div class="text-box">
		<p>If you are bored of the regular sabji and dal, well look in your own kitchen for some inspiration. And you know what inspired me, our very good old friend, the favorite side dish- the crunchy the spices- Papad.

If you are surprised when don’t be, save that when you actually taste the Papad ki sabji! It tastes great packed with a spicy punch and that sour tempering prepared using curd that thickens the gravy and is delectable.

If you are feeling more indulgent do try mango curry that plays amazingly with your taste buds. Experimenting is the key!</p>
